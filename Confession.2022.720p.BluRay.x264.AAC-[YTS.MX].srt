1
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:12,809
Yoo Min-ho, a suspect
in the murder of Kim Se-hee,

2
00:01:12,892 --> 00:01:15,446
was released today

3
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:17,992
after the arrest warrant
was invalidated.

4
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:21,493
Yoo's marriage to a daughter
of Na-in Group, Lee Ji-yeon

5
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:22,999
made headlines,

6
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:24,600
but he is said
to have been having an affair

7
00:01:24,624 --> 00:01:27,165
with the slain Ms. Kim.

8
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,442
The prosecution hopes
to acquire more evidence

9
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:31,386
and get a new warrant,

10
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,594
while Mr. Yoo is considering
his options for a defense lawyer.

11
00:01:45,498 --> 00:01:46,747
Hello?

12
00:01:49,586 --> 00:01:52,713
Yes. I will leave right away.

24
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,760
You have reached your destination.

25
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:10,663
Mr. Yoo Min-ho?
I am Attorney Yang Shin-ae.

26
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:13,245
Hello.

27
00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:16,481
Attorney Jang called me.

28
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:18,295
He said you were hurrying over.

29
00:05:18,378 --> 00:05:19,776
I was heading to the hotel

30
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:21,342
when I received
some new information.

31
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:24,886
It could not wait
until our meeting in the morning.

32
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:28,388
Can I come in?

33
00:05:29,013 --> 00:05:30,142
Thanks.

34
00:05:30,975 --> 00:05:32,977
I guess Attorney Jang is busy.

35
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:34,874
He will come after finishing up.

36
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:35,957
This way.

37
00:05:38,315 --> 00:05:40,672
This was far for you to come

38
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:42,443
after an all-night interrogation.

39
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:45,615
I had to escape the press.

40
00:05:46,406 --> 00:05:50,368
You have not escaped
the prosecution, though.

41
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:51,951
Police are stationed 5 minutes

42
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:53,370
from here.

43
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:58,002
(Attorney Yang Shin-ae)

44
00:05:59,171 --> 00:06:00,877
Is coffee okay?

45
00:06:22,984 --> 00:06:24,986
Is this
the Chairman's family cabin?

46
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:27,697
It used to be.

47
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,888
His wife's family grave
was nearby,

48
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:31,003
but since it was moved,

49
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:32,413
no one comes.

50
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:35,163
Just me sometimes,
to clear my head.

51
00:06:41,462 --> 00:06:43,464
Thank you for taking
on the defense.

52
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:49,802
Let me be clear.

53
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:51,954
I will decide whether to do it

54
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,182
after hearing the whole story,
and...

55
00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:56,978
what you should be grateful for
is the Chairman.

56
00:06:57,061 --> 00:07:00,149
I never imagined the warrant
would be nullified.

57
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:06,111
The prosecution obtained
game-changing evidence.

58
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:09,699
A new arrest warrant could be
issued at dawn.

59
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:14,703
Arrest warrant?
But I did not kill her.

60
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:16,914
The prosecution thinks
differently.

61
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:22,752
What do you think?

62
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:26,131
There are too many holes
in your testimony.

63
00:07:26,214 --> 00:07:28,216
Let's hear it from the beginning.

64
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:38,561
How long were you seeing
Kim Se-hee?

65
00:07:38,644 --> 00:07:40,458
For a year and a half,

66
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,024
but it ended last fall.

67
00:07:43,107 --> 00:07:45,109
Then why meet her again?

68
00:07:49,446 --> 00:07:52,282
I received a blackmail threat
that morning.

69
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:54,265
I had to pay $1 million,

70
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,628
or they would reveal the affair.

71
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:58,553
I did not have that much on me,

72
00:07:58,636 --> 00:07:59,832
but I took what I had.

73
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:04,085
Checking in?

74
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:06,172
Room 514, please.

75
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:10,467
Your guest has already gone up
to the room.

76
00:08:16,642 --> 00:08:20,018
I did not expect both of us
to be under the same threat.

77
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:22,792
They told us to wait
in the room.

78
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,273
So we did.

79
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,192
Had you gone there
with Kim Se-hee before?

80
00:08:28,654 --> 00:08:30,071
No.

81
00:08:30,154 --> 00:08:31,243
Why did they call you

82
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:32,698
to such a far-off place?

83
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,952
Does that matter?

84
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:36,315
You must explain all the details

85
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:38,164
to get an innocent verdict.

86
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:39,706
Why didn't you report it?

87
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,791
The affair was already over,

88
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,295
and I did not want my wife
to know.

89
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:46,488
Did you think

90
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:48,214
you had a lot to lose?

91
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:50,299
I never thought that way.

92
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,217
Please continue.

93
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:05,482
We waited for about an hour.

94
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:19,036
What is going on?

95
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:24,001
Something is not right.

96
00:09:25,794 --> 00:09:27,796
Let's go!

97
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,273
When I woke up,

98
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:48,317
I heard knocking.

99
00:09:58,035 --> 00:10:00,494
Excuse me, sir?

100
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:07,501
Are you in there?

101
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,969
Sir, this is the police.

102
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:19,056
Please open the door.

103
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:25,771
This is the police.
Open the door!

104
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:34,115
We are responding to a call.

105
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:36,613
Are you in there?

106
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,749
Se-hee! Se-hee!

107
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:51,797
Se-hee, wake up.

108
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:58,135
Help!

109
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:01,430
Help!

110
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:05,687
Se-hee...

111
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,938
Freeze!

112
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:09,648
Hands up!

113
00:11:09,731 --> 00:11:11,358
Move slowly.

114
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:13,776
Slowly, come out of there.

115
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:15,028
Come out!

116
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:18,156
It was not me.

117
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:20,698
- I did not do this.
- Step outside!

118
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:26,225
- Don't move!
- It was not me.

119
00:11:26,308 --> 00:11:28,875
- Don't move!
- Someone else was here!

120
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,330
Stay still!

121
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:33,211
Don't move!

122
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:35,296
Another person is here!

123
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:40,053
Another person is here!

124
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:49,856
According to police records,

125
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:53,400
a housekeeper was outside
Room 514 at that time,

126
00:11:53,483 --> 00:11:56,025
but she did not see anyone
exit the room.

127
00:11:56,108 --> 00:11:57,631
Plus, it is impossible to come out

128
00:11:57,714 --> 00:12:00,490
with the keychain locked.

129
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:03,032
So the only place left is
the balcony,

130
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:06,120
But that too was locked
from the inside.

131
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:08,601
They checked
every possible means of entry,

132
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:10,917
and found nothing.

133
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,253
The police see this
as a closed-door crime,

134
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:17,235
so if your testimony is true,

135
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:20,886
did the criminal simply vanish?

136
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,262
I don't know.

137
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:25,892
And how did he get in?

138
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:27,977
Must have been inside already.

139
00:12:28,518 --> 00:12:31,623
Someone framed me.

140
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:32,607
Who?

141
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,921
I don't know.

142
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:36,443
The police should catch him.

143
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:37,766
You need more than intelligence

144
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:39,570
to create good testimony.

145
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:41,779
You need creativity.

146
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,326
Your testimony has no creativity.

147
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:46,121
I am telling the truth.

148
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:47,997
Why do I need creativity?

149
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:51,384
With that testimony,

150
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:54,335
you are the only one
who saw a third person.

151
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:57,298
You are obviously the criminal.

152
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,381
Ms. Yang.

153
00:13:01,342 --> 00:13:02,710
It was not me.

154
00:13:03,686 --> 00:13:05,222
I did not do it.

155
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,645
(Manager Han)

156
00:13:14,063 --> 00:13:15,857
Hello?

157
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,112
Is it confirmed?

158
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,572
Yes.

159
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:25,572
Yes.

160
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:27,701
Okay, then.

161
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,997
I found out
what the new evidence is.

162
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:36,169
A witness at the crime scene.

163
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:39,049
Is that possible?

164
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:40,631
You called it a closed-door crime.

165
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:41,884
That is right.

166
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:44,801
There can't be any witnesses
to Kim Se-hee's murder.

167
00:13:45,595 --> 00:13:47,804
Then what crime did this

168
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,807
new witness see?

169
00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:54,519
I don't follow you.

170
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:02,656
My clients typically fall
into two groups.

171
00:14:04,236 --> 00:14:05,605
Some clients confess

172
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:07,160
and cooperate.

173
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:10,265
And some want to go free
without a drop of blood

174
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:12,244
on their hands.

175
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:18,588
(Missing Person)

176
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:23,459
If you didn't recognize him,

177
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,467
you would have looked closer.

178
00:14:26,135 --> 00:14:27,449
You glanced away quickly,

179
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:29,054
so you know this person.

180
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:33,330
Is the new witness connected

181
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:35,645
to this missing person case?

182
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:40,184
If your lawyer does not know
what the prosecution knows,

183
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,651
it is a lost cause.

184
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:45,041
I need to know everything

185
00:14:45,124 --> 00:14:46,908
to rebut the witness's testimony.

186
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:48,990
Tell me.

187
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:58,834
If you waste time like this,

188
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:01,046
you will surely be arrested.

189
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:14,143
It was two months ago.

190
00:15:21,815 --> 00:15:23,069
Hi, honey.

191
00:15:23,152 --> 00:15:26,072
- Where are you?
- Busan.

192
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:27,614
Is everything fine?

193
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:29,868
Conferences are all the same.

194
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:31,826
Discussions, meetings...

195
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:33,911
You sound tired.

196
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:37,376
It will go fine.

197
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:39,834
Dad does not say it,
but he expects a lot.

198
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:42,398
Doesn't he expect a grandchild

199
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:45,091
more than anything?

200
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:47,469
How about talking face-to-face?

201
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:50,761
Are you coming
to the opening today?

202
00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:53,183
Are the preparations going well?

203
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:55,394
Don't deflect my question.

204
00:15:55,477 --> 00:15:57,479
You will be back later, right?

205
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:01,190
Hello?

206
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:03,273
Hello?

207
00:16:03,356 --> 00:16:05,319
Sorry, what did you say?

208
00:16:05,402 --> 00:16:07,404
When will you leave?

209
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:10,825
As soon as I finish up here.

210
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:12,659
Hurry, I miss you.

211
00:16:12,742 --> 00:16:14,744
Miss you too.

212
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:19,751
Going already?

213
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:21,836
It is late.

214
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:25,780
Stay a bit longer.

215
00:16:26,343 --> 00:16:27,965
You are not sober yet.

216
00:16:29,134 --> 00:16:31,261
Drive for me, will you?

217
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:33,596
The two of you came here?

218
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,681
We had no other place
to go unnoticed.

219
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,580
Se-hee liked it here,

220
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:39,977
but I was uncomfortable.

221
00:16:52,282 --> 00:16:55,371
- What?
- My bracelet.

222
00:16:55,454 --> 00:16:56,703
I left it at the lodge.

223
00:16:56,786 --> 00:16:58,788
I will get it next time.

224
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:25,191
- Turn right.
- Not the main road?

225
00:17:25,274 --> 00:17:27,276
It is a shortcut.
And no cameras.

226
00:17:40,623 --> 00:17:42,456
What is wrong?

227
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,043
I am tired.

228
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:50,007
Tired of lying.

229
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:52,301
You are honest with me.

230
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:54,486
I have to lie to everyone

231
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:56,598
except you.

232
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:04,467
Do you remember what we said

233
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,607
when we first met?

234
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,153
Just being together is enough.

235
00:18:08,236 --> 00:18:09,820
Think like that.

236
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:14,072
One can't have everything.

237
00:18:14,155 --> 00:18:16,157
Then can you choose?

238
00:18:23,997 --> 00:18:25,999
I am not interested in marriage.

239
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:30,211
So what we have is perfect.

240
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:38,264
Do you want to end it?

241
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:43,269
Let's do that.

242
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,963
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I am okay.

243
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:43,577
Hello?

244
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,132
Are you okay?

245
00:19:57,883 --> 00:19:59,345
Hello?

246
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:27,999
What are you doing?

247
00:20:28,082 --> 00:20:30,248
- We should report it.
- Wait!

248
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:32,333
There was nothing we could do.

249
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:35,272
He was texting,

250
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:36,799
not wearing a seatbelt.

251
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:38,153
What does that matter?

252
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:39,653
The accident was our fault.

253
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:41,012
We did not hit him!

254
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:43,845
- He hit the boulder.
- So what?

255
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,982
You and I are not supposed
to be here now.

256
00:20:54,693 --> 00:20:57,026
If you call the cops,
we are finished.

257
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:04,033
Nobody saw it.

258
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:08,371
We can just keep driving.

259
00:21:08,454 --> 00:21:10,912
- Don't be absurd!
- Listen.

260
00:21:11,372 --> 00:21:13,374
All you have accomplished...

261
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:17,463
Your family.

262
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:21,303
Your family!

263
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,306
What about them?

264
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:27,889
Huh?

265
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,936
Let's go.

266
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:37,275
- Why won't it start?
- Come on!

267
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:39,360
Please, just...

268
00:21:40,654 --> 00:21:42,656
Hold on.

269
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:03,008
Wait.

270
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:31,583
What are you doing?

271
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,540
We are discussing the accident.

272
00:22:33,623 --> 00:22:36,250
- I am that car's driver.
- What?

273
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,836
- Just follow my lead.
- You...!

274
00:22:47,597 --> 00:22:50,602
Oh my...
Seems you had an accident?

275
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:54,396
An elk jumped out on the road.
Our cars skidded.

276
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:57,648
Does nobody hurt?

277
00:22:57,731 --> 00:22:59,733
No, we are fine.

278
00:23:10,537 --> 00:23:12,872
Sounds like your phone is ringing.

279
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:14,957
Must be the insurance company.

280
00:23:23,316 --> 00:23:24,693
(Gwon Min-jun)

281
00:23:30,012 --> 00:23:32,014
Are you sure you are okay?

282
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:36,185
A bit startled, but fine.

283
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:39,481
Well, then...

284
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:56,290
Yes, please do that.

285
00:23:59,793 --> 00:24:01,795
As quickly as possible.

286
00:24:06,216 --> 00:24:07,927
All set now.

287
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,304
That is a relief.
Drive safely.

288
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:12,931
Yes, thank you.

289
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:24,903
Are you sure
the witness did not see the body?

290
00:24:24,986 --> 00:24:27,407
I was not there,

291
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,323
so I can only trust
what Se-hee said.

292
00:24:29,406 --> 00:24:30,950
The license plate?

293
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:32,452
I did not see it.

294
00:24:32,535 --> 00:24:34,003
Is the prosecution's new witness

295
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:36,456
that truck driver?

296
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,541
Right now it seems likely.

297
00:24:54,307 --> 00:24:56,309
Go, quickly.

298
00:24:57,267 --> 00:24:59,269
And you?

299
00:24:59,893 --> 00:25:01,895
I will figure something out.

300
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,526
As you said, we didn't hit him.

301
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:08,609
We can still report it.

302
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:10,989
Get rid of this car,
and it is finished.

303
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,662
And we are finished.

304
00:25:17,787 --> 00:25:19,789
Just as you wanted.

305
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:44,646
I was plagued by regret.

306
00:25:49,362 --> 00:25:51,364
I should not have gone that way.

307
00:25:52,406 --> 00:25:56,034
If I had gone left,
there would have been no accident.

308
00:25:57,744 --> 00:25:59,746
Nothing would have happened.

309
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:03,293
I remembered what Se-hee said.

310
00:26:04,126 --> 00:26:06,168
He is already dead.

311
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:08,280
He has no future,

312
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,548
but we do.

313
00:26:13,427 --> 00:26:15,429
And then?

314
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:18,813
After ditching the car,

315
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:21,435
I met Se-hee again.

316
00:26:34,657 --> 00:26:36,576
What is wrong?

317
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,661
What?

318
00:26:45,544 --> 00:26:47,566
For roadside repair,

319
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,673
please approve the use
of location data.

320
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:52,943
Your call may be recorded...

321
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:27,666
Excuse me.
Are you having trouble?

322
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:30,821
I skidded to avoid an elk,

323
00:27:30,904 --> 00:27:32,800
but now it won't start.

324
00:27:32,883 --> 00:27:36,343
- Didn't you get hurt?
- No, I am fine.

325
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:38,428
Did you call for help?

326
00:27:40,053 --> 00:27:42,893
Not yet.
They said it would take a while.

327
00:27:45,187 --> 00:27:46,583
I can take a look.

328
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:48,731
Want to open the hood?

329
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:55,653
I run a car repair shop.

330
00:27:56,863 --> 00:27:58,865
- Just a minute.
- Okay.

331
00:28:03,706 --> 00:28:05,708
It is my sister's car.

332
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:09,374
There is a lever down
on the left.

333
00:28:12,377 --> 00:28:14,379
Oh, right...

334
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,475
Just a minute.

335
00:28:31,858 --> 00:28:34,754
Don't see anything wrong.

336
00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:36,656
The ECU must have re-set.

337
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:38,758
Cars have so much electronics,

338
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:40,242
one error can shut them down.

339
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:47,499
How about coming to my house?

340
00:28:47,582 --> 00:28:50,461
I will plug in a scanner
and fix the settings.

341
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:56,215
Or should I call a tow truck?

342
00:28:56,298 --> 00:28:57,593
How long will it take?

343
00:28:57,676 --> 00:29:00,386
- The tow truck?
- No. To fix it.

344
00:29:01,764 --> 00:29:04,161
With travel time,

345
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:05,892
an hour should do it.

346
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:09,772
Please do that, then.

347
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,862
Here.

You are not from around here?

350
00:29:25,304 --> 00:29:26,829
Neither am I.

351
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:30,416
We moved here
when my wife got sick.

352
00:29:30,793 --> 00:29:32,645
We did all the chemotherapy,

353
00:29:32,728 --> 00:29:34,398
but the treatment is worse

354
00:29:35,005 --> 00:29:37,046
than the disease.

355
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:42,092
She got better
after moving here, though.

356
00:29:42,175 --> 00:29:45,972
She is even started working again.

357
00:29:47,056 --> 00:29:50,312
- That is great.
- Yes.

358
00:29:57,528 --> 00:29:58,610
Producer Lee?

359
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:00,695
Se-hee, how is the video coming?

360
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,323
I finished editing
and uploaded it to the cloud.

361
00:30:04,406 --> 00:30:05,324
Then when are you coming?

362
00:30:05,407 --> 00:30:07,409
The thing is...

363
00:30:08,747 --> 00:30:10,458
Something came up.

364
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:13,127
I will go as fast as I can.

365
00:30:18,172 --> 00:30:20,174
Do you work in video?

366
00:30:23,177 --> 00:30:24,595
Yes.

367
00:30:25,387 --> 00:30:27,389
I met my wife
at a broadcasting company.

368
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:29,911
She was a local news reporter,

369
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,854
and I drove the broadcast van.

370
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:37,151
Basically, I was her manager.

371
00:30:37,523 --> 00:30:41,905
I took care of clothes,
makeup, even her meals,

372
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:43,990
so she just said,
let's just get married!

373
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:46,422
She is the type to make up

374
00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:49,328
her mind in five seconds.

375
00:30:49,411 --> 00:30:51,306
If she had not gotten sick,

376
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:54,248
she would be a news anchor
by now.

Let's take a look.

379
00:31:29,952 --> 00:31:32,331
Oh my, I woke you.

380
00:31:32,414 --> 00:31:34,416
It is all fixed now.

381
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,002
Just a minute!

382
00:31:40,939 --> 00:31:43,715
- How much do I...?
- No, no, no.

383
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:46,175
Just consider it a favor.

384
00:31:48,094 --> 00:31:50,575
Sorry, I did not get you anything.

385
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,778
Have some chrysanthemum tea.

386
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,060
No, I am fine.

387
00:31:53,143 --> 00:31:55,686
It won't take a minute.
Bring it with you.

388
00:31:56,354 --> 00:31:58,333
My son dried the tea himself.

389
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,732
Perfect weather for it.

Growing up with a sick mother,

393
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,327
I guess he wanted to stay close.

395

403
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:38,281
Of course, he left.

404
00:32:38,364 --> 00:32:40,314
He left right away.

405
00:32:41,147 --> 00:32:42,373
Didn't he show up?

406
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:44,984
And he is not answering the phone?

407
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:46,777
That is strange.

408
00:32:48,491 --> 00:32:50,493
Let me call you back.

409
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:52,535
Hello?

410
00:33:07,381 --> 00:33:08,883
(Dad)

411
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:09,403
Look, he forgot
to take his phone!

412
00:34:11,907 --> 00:34:13,909
I will be going now.

413
00:34:16,535 --> 00:34:17,700
But...

414
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:51,947
Then what do we do now?

415
00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:56,243
I have an idea.

416
00:34:59,494 --> 00:35:01,496
But I can't do it myself.

417
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:06,253
Se-hee told me about her plan.

418
00:35:07,462 --> 00:35:09,286
I could not believe

419
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:11,298
she came up with it so quickly.

420
00:35:11,381 --> 00:35:13,383
Felt like a plan hatched
over a lifetime.

421
00:35:14,384 --> 00:35:16,386
The look in her eye scared me.

422
00:35:17,303 --> 00:35:19,743
We promised that would be
our last meeting,

423
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:20,826
and left.

424
00:35:50,921 --> 00:35:55,134
Lastly, let's watch the video
that we prepared.

425
00:35:55,217 --> 00:35:59,599
Thanks for coming to the opening
of the Haseon Art Gallery.

426
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,987
Did you hear it all?

427
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,072
You did great.

428
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:36,468
We succeeded somehow,

429
00:36:36,551 --> 00:36:39,429
but I worried it could fall apart
in an instant.

430
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:44,835
What?

431
00:36:44,918 --> 00:36:46,477
Do you want to junk the car?

432
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:51,313
It is at the construction site.
Make sure it can't be traced.

433
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,487
Why there?

434
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,652
It was a simple accident.

435
00:36:56,735 --> 00:36:57,820
Just don't want trouble.

436
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:03,746
Anything else?
Just the car?

437
00:37:04,871 --> 00:37:06,873
Do that for me.

438
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:13,356
Scrapping it will leave a record,

439
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,581
better to strip

440
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:15,923
and export it.

441
00:37:16,006 --> 00:37:18,471
If we use a professional,

442
00:37:18,554 --> 00:37:19,554
they won't cause trouble

443
00:37:19,596 --> 00:37:21,011
because they are illegal, too.

444
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,756
I am your lawyer.

445
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,600
If you need anything, say it.

446
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,980
And just focus on the deal.

447
00:37:32,523 --> 00:37:34,400
There was no more trouble,

448
00:37:34,483 --> 00:37:36,360
but I could not rest from work.

449
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:38,210
I was preparing to export

450
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:40,032
my security program to China.

451
00:37:40,115 --> 00:37:42,785
The fate of the company depended
on it.

452
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,207
Make sure it can't be traced.

453
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,292
Don't worry.

454
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:57,464
There are many concerns
with your proposal.

455
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,552
Your software is too expensive,

456
00:38:00,635 --> 00:38:01,956
long development period,

457
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:04,348
maintenance issue in China.

458
00:38:04,431 --> 00:38:06,657
And the most important thing,
your software is not verified!

459
00:38:06,681 --> 00:38:09,103
(You have a visitor
from the police station.)

460
00:38:15,735 --> 00:38:18,610
Sir. It is totally cost-effective.

461
00:38:18,693 --> 00:38:21,989
We will create and build
this system as soon as possible.

462
00:38:22,072 --> 00:38:23,486
Then you will be the very first

463
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:24,569
and the best in China.

464
00:38:25,328 --> 00:38:28,039
At 5:40 p.m. on that day,

465
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:30,577
Han Sun-jae drove out
to meet a friend,

466
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,584
and disappeared.

467
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:35,002
His car vanished as well.

468
00:38:35,085 --> 00:38:37,211
The boy's father stopped

469
00:38:37,294 --> 00:38:39,091
on his way home to tow

470
00:38:39,174 --> 00:38:42,802
and fix a car
that had broken down.

471
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:45,974
He said a woman was driving it.

472
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,476
Some parts that were found

473
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,895
where the car broke down matched
Han Sun-jae's missing car.

474
00:38:51,978 --> 00:38:54,048
At the very spot

475
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,483
where the father towed her car,

476
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:58,610
there are signs
that a car struck a boulder.

477
00:38:58,693 --> 00:39:02,073
But strangely enough,
no accident was reported.

478
00:39:02,156 --> 00:39:03,531
So?

479
00:39:03,614 --> 00:39:05,108
What does an incident in Gangwon

480
00:39:05,191 --> 00:39:06,995
have to do with us?

481
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,997
The site of Han's accident...

482
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,599
You said he is missing.

483
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,957
You can't assume it was him.

484
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:19,756
His presumed accident matches

485
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,427
the location of that woman.

486
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,820
And the boy's father remembers

487
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:27,515
the car's license plate.

488
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,747
A search showed that

489
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,478
the car belongs to this company.

490
00:39:33,561 --> 00:39:37,397
Mostly driven by you, sir.

491
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,193
Any employee can drive
a company car.

492
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:42,855
And I told you.

493
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:45,405
It was stolen.

494
00:39:45,488 --> 00:39:47,136
We reported you the day after

495
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:48,951
our CEO came back from Busan.

496
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:53,416
What were you doing in Busan?

497
00:39:54,249 --> 00:39:56,629
There was a conference.

498
00:39:56,712 --> 00:39:59,464
And about the license plate,

499
00:39:59,547 --> 00:40:03,468
we can't be sure the father
remembered correctly, can we?

500
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:05,009
Can we see records

501
00:40:05,092 --> 00:40:06,763
on the use of the company car?

502
00:40:06,846 --> 00:40:08,765
How about we stop?

503
00:40:08,848 --> 00:40:10,350
Or you can get a warrant.

504
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:12,645
Don't you want
to find your stolen car?

505
00:40:12,728 --> 00:40:15,103
The Transportation Division will
find it.

506
00:40:15,186 --> 00:40:16,915
It is not your jurisdiction,

507
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,146
so don't pull in my client

508
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:20,523
without evidence.

509
00:40:22,817 --> 00:40:25,781
We are busy,
so why don't you go?

510
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,033
We will go.

511
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:51,408
The car looked fine.

512
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:54,016
Why so nervous
about a tiny incident?

513
00:40:57,897 --> 00:41:00,022
I was only in Busan
on the first day.

514
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,402
What about the second day?

515
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:07,281
With that woman?

516
00:41:12,158 --> 00:41:14,160
You will need an alibi, then.

517
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,488
And the missing person?

518
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,959
Any connection?

519
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:28,721
Find a truck for me.

520
00:41:28,804 --> 00:41:29,886
Know the license number?

521
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:31,663
I just know the model, color,

522
00:41:32,251 --> 00:41:34,225
and driver's face.

523
00:41:36,644 --> 00:41:39,147
That will take time.

524
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,857
What about the police?

525
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:44,667
You saw them.

526
00:41:45,137 --> 00:41:47,780
They still can't touch you.

527
00:41:47,863 --> 00:41:49,834
So I got an alibi,

528
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:52,076
and no more contact
from the police.

529
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,750
I thought it was over,

530
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,455
then the real nightmare started.

531
00:41:56,832 --> 00:42:00,460
Daddy wants to go on a trip,
where should we go?

532
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,378
I am glad to go anywhere,
you decide.

533
00:42:05,004 --> 00:42:06,257
Let's see...

534
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,152
The missing person case
of Han Sun-jae is now

535
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,179
a public investigation.

536
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:14,265
Gangwon police and residents are
combing the area,

537
00:42:14,348 --> 00:42:15,852
but the mountainous terrain is

538
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,642
making the search difficult.

539
00:42:17,725 --> 00:42:19,227
They still have not found him.

540
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,981
Police say it may not be
a simple disappearance...

541
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:23,484
Right.

542
00:42:23,567 --> 00:42:27,319
But they are waiting
for conclusive evidence.

543
00:42:27,402 --> 00:42:31,239
Police are also tracing the
whereabouts of one woman.

544
00:42:31,322 --> 00:42:33,449
She was seen
by the missing man's father,

545
00:42:33,532 --> 00:42:36,204
and was driving a stolen vehicle
on that day.

546
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,683
Police are investigating
a possible link

547
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:41,710
to the missing person case.

548
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:45,422
This is Ma Jeong-pil
on the scene for YTN News.

549
00:42:45,505 --> 00:42:47,507
Would you like some more wine?

550
00:42:49,092 --> 00:42:50,802
Sure.

551
00:43:05,553 --> 00:43:06,715
Are you crazy?

552
00:43:06,798 --> 00:43:07,692
How dare you call this number?

553
00:43:07,775 --> 00:43:09,420
Did you watch the news?
What is going on?

554
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,421
What?

555
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,328
Is it not a simple disappearance?

556
00:43:12,411 --> 00:43:13,905
Why am I a suspect?

557
00:43:13,988 --> 00:43:15,990
What did you tell the police?

558
00:43:25,793 --> 00:43:27,627
Police saw signs of an accident,

559
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,115
but no one reported it,

560
00:43:29,198 --> 00:43:30,798
so they are suspicious.

561
00:43:30,881 --> 00:43:32,883
Who decided
to report the car stolen?

562
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:38,599
The car disappeared,
it would be strange not to.

563
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:40,684
Then you should have told me!

564
00:43:46,188 --> 00:43:47,732
What is that?

565
00:43:47,815 --> 00:43:51,317
His wallet. I removed it
while putting him in the trunk.

566
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,655
What should I do with it?

567
00:43:55,738 --> 00:43:58,241
All you need is in there.

568
00:43:58,324 --> 00:44:00,580
His ID, business card,
even credit cards.

569
00:44:02,165 --> 00:44:03,792
Do you think it is possible?

570
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,877
Make it possible.

571
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:08,381
It is your specialty.

572
00:44:08,464 --> 00:44:10,465
The accident could not be helped.

573
00:44:11,343 --> 00:44:13,841
But that is a crime!

574
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:16,218
You hid the body.

575
00:44:17,136 --> 00:44:19,223
Isn't that a crime?

576
00:44:19,306 --> 00:44:20,933
What?

577
00:44:21,016 --> 00:44:23,727
You feel safe
because the father didn't see you,

578
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:27,061
but I won't go down alone.

579
00:44:29,231 --> 00:44:30,610
Never.

580
00:44:39,118 --> 00:44:42,661
(Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office)

(Financial Transactions
of Suspicious Accounts)

583
00:45:11,234 --> 00:45:12,806
I accessed criminal records

584
00:45:12,889 --> 00:45:14,778
for a voice phishing case.

585
00:45:18,112 --> 00:45:20,284
By fabricating transactions,

586
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:23,955
I made it look like it was linked
to the Han Sun-jae case.

587
00:45:30,377 --> 00:45:35,299
Was this all Se-hee's idea?

588
00:45:35,382 --> 00:45:38,053
You don't know her.

589
00:45:40,134 --> 00:45:42,555
She is the type
who never gives up.

590
00:45:42,638 --> 00:45:45,076
Han Sun-jae's case is being turned

591
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,396
into a criminal investigation.

592
00:45:47,479 --> 00:45:48,871
(Criminal Investigation Opens)

593
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,646
Several days
before his disappearance,

594
00:45:50,729 --> 00:45:52,538
a voice phishing organization made

595
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:54,774
suspicious deposits

596
00:45:54,857 --> 00:45:57,738
into the bank account
of the missing man.

597
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:02,073
The police conducted a search
for the residence,

598
00:46:02,156 --> 00:46:05,121
believing that Han had disappeared
on his own.

599
00:46:05,204 --> 00:46:07,807
With the police investigating Han,

600
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,957
we were no longer under suspicion.

601
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:12,713
We concluded the deal,

602
00:46:12,796 --> 00:46:15,298
and I was named
IT Businessman of the Year.

603
00:46:15,963 --> 00:46:17,348
I was soaked with congratulations

604
00:46:17,431 --> 00:46:18,802
and interview requests.

605
00:46:19,675 --> 00:46:22,429
But it was all such a sham.

606
00:46:23,222 --> 00:46:25,224
I felt sick inside.

607
00:46:32,564 --> 00:46:33,981
Hello?

608
00:46:34,064 --> 00:46:36,612
- Is Ms. Yang there?
- She is with me now.

609
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:38,779
She signed
the defense agreement?

610
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:40,864
No, not yet.

611
00:46:43,242 --> 00:46:45,577
Tell her everything.

612
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,164
She is never lost a case.

613
00:46:48,247 --> 00:46:51,832
Make sure
she signs the agreement.

614
00:46:51,915 --> 00:46:53,083
All right.

615
00:46:54,502 --> 00:46:59,552
And I think I found the truck.

616
00:46:59,635 --> 00:47:01,637
Really? And the driver?

617
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:04,427
The truck was there,
but his house was empty.

618
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:08,100
The prosecution is certainly
moving fast.

619
00:47:08,183 --> 00:47:09,101
What do you mean?

620
00:47:09,184 --> 00:47:10,560
The prosecution's witness may be

621
00:47:10,643 --> 00:47:11,644
that truck driver.

622
00:47:11,727 --> 00:47:12,853
Witness?

623
00:47:12,936 --> 00:47:15,568
The evidence they have is
a witness?

624
00:47:15,651 --> 00:47:17,653
That is what Ms. Yang heard.

625
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:22,866
- Let me speak to her.
- Just a second, please.

626
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:26,369
It is Attorney Jang.

627
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,661
Hello?

628
00:47:28,744 --> 00:47:30,791
Ms. Yang, thanks for your help.

629
00:47:30,874 --> 00:47:31,874
Yes.

630
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:34,209
What is this about a witness?

631
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:37,105
I am trying
to find out the details.

632
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,838
I am not sure who...

633
00:47:39,463 --> 00:47:41,757
- Hello?
- Hello?

634
00:47:44,303 --> 00:47:45,509
Hello?

635
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:50,974
We were cut off.

636
00:47:52,768 --> 00:47:56,023
So all the cards are on the table.

637
00:47:57,732 --> 00:47:59,734
Two incidents.

638
00:48:00,904 --> 00:48:02,906
Two bodies.

639
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,552
The police only know
Se-hee's murder,

640
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,162
so you are the only suspect.

641
00:48:10,245 --> 00:48:11,836
They need to know about Han

642
00:48:11,919 --> 00:48:13,833
to see other possibilities.

643
00:48:14,249 --> 00:48:16,712
The third person hidden
in that room is surely connected

644
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:19,795
to Han Sun-jae.

645
00:48:22,381 --> 00:48:24,299
Did you say you were blackmailed?

646
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:27,139
Sir!

647
00:48:27,222 --> 00:48:30,142
- This came for you.
- Who sent it?

648
00:48:30,225 --> 00:48:32,892
No sender is written.

649
00:48:46,906 --> 00:48:48,460
The price of my silence is

650
00:48:48,543 --> 00:48:50,078
$1 million in cash.

651
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:51,293
If you bring anyone,

652
00:48:51,376 --> 00:48:53,205
or report this,

653
00:48:53,288 --> 00:48:55,290
I will reveal your infidelity.

654
00:49:01,044 --> 00:49:02,044
Mr. Yoo.

655
00:49:02,758 --> 00:49:04,760
I can't listen anymore.

656
00:49:05,969 --> 00:49:08,363
I understand
why you would call this blackmail

657
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,138
over infidelity.

658
00:49:10,221 --> 00:49:12,933
Because you want to keep
the Han Sun-jae incident secret.

659
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:14,888
Answer one of three questions,

660
00:49:14,971 --> 00:49:15,971
and I will believe it.

661
00:49:16,227 --> 00:49:19,215
First, who called the cops

662
00:49:19,298 --> 00:49:21,375
before the attack in the hotel?

663
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,131
- This is the police.
- Second,

664
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:25,946
why didn't the blackmailer
take the money?

665
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:29,156
Third, how did he leave
the closed room?

666
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,123
You can't answer.

667
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:38,309
So it is not convincing to say

668
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,875
it was a blackmail
over infidelity.

669
00:49:41,753 --> 00:49:43,691
Forget creativity,

670
00:49:43,774 --> 00:49:44,964
your logic is a mess.

671
00:49:46,381 --> 00:49:49,469
Then what is your logic?

672
00:49:52,516 --> 00:49:54,935
You say both
of you got the same threat?

673
00:49:55,018 --> 00:49:57,937
Yes, but only I was asked
for money.

674
00:49:59,354 --> 00:50:01,356
The way I view this incident...

675
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:05,320
Something is not right.

676
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:07,655
Let's go.

677
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,442
Wait a minute.

678
00:50:46,734 --> 00:50:49,446
Do you think
the boy's father killed her?

679
00:50:49,529 --> 00:50:52,616
Han Young-seok has
the clearest motivation.

680
00:50:53,032 --> 00:50:54,950
What is his motivation?

681
00:50:55,371 --> 00:50:56,371
Revenge.

682
00:50:59,663 --> 00:51:01,458
Look at this.

683
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:03,043
My son made a call

684
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,753
before I met that woman.

685
00:51:04,836 --> 00:51:06,799
She carried the phone
to my house.

686
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,341
There are no grounds
to see it as an accident.

687
00:51:09,424 --> 00:51:12,324
And that woman was not alone.

688
00:51:12,617 --> 00:51:13,535
There was a passenger.

689
00:51:13,618 --> 00:51:14,953
You only saw her.

690
00:51:15,036 --> 00:51:15,954
What is your evidence?

691
00:51:16,037 --> 00:51:17,702
I told you!

692
00:51:17,785 --> 00:51:19,812
She adjusted the car seat.

693
00:51:19,895 --> 00:51:22,062
It was not her car!

694
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:24,232
It is my sister's car.

695
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:26,066
The car is not hers.

696
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,001
It belongs to D&T Security.

697
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:28,985
Sir.

698
00:51:29,068 --> 00:51:33,280
I am begging you.
Please investigate, okay?

699
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,660
Han Sun-jae!

700
00:51:37,284 --> 00:51:38,622
Sun-jae!

701
00:51:39,832 --> 00:51:41,834
Everybody move!

702
00:51:43,042 --> 00:51:45,585
We have the warrant
to search your home.

703
00:51:46,586 --> 00:51:47,840
But...

704
00:51:47,923 --> 00:51:50,130
Start with his room!

705
00:51:50,213 --> 00:51:51,884
What is going on?

706
00:51:51,967 --> 00:51:55,272
Your son may have been involved

707
00:51:55,355 --> 00:51:56,805
in financial crimes.

708
00:51:56,888 --> 00:51:58,434
My son?

709
00:51:58,766 --> 00:52:00,144
Honey!

710
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:08,985
Sun-jae!

711
00:52:09,068 --> 00:52:12,320
A parent who loses
a child is already a monster.

712
00:52:12,612 --> 00:52:14,418
If the son is wrongly accused,

713
00:52:14,501 --> 00:52:16,324
and he can't even find the body,

714
00:52:16,407 --> 00:52:17,825
he might do anything.

715
00:52:19,163 --> 00:52:22,205
Han Young-seok lost his faith
in the police,

716
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:25,878
so he prepared
to judge you directly.

717
00:52:25,961 --> 00:52:27,557
The price of my silence is

718
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,640
$1 million in cash.

719
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:30,025
If you bring anyone,

720
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:31,592
or report this,

721
00:52:31,675 --> 00:52:33,801
I will reveal your infidelity.

722
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,182
He would have been convinced

723
00:52:37,265 --> 00:52:39,600
that he would not be suspected.

724
00:52:40,684 --> 00:52:44,229
Because he knew
you would never talk

725
00:52:44,312 --> 00:52:46,146
about his son's case.

726
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:47,817
That weakness was

727
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,902
what he targeted.

728
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:56,992
And he succeeded.

729
00:52:57,573 --> 00:53:00,011
He made everyone think that you,

730
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:02,662
her illicit lover, killed Se-hee.

731
00:53:04,917 --> 00:53:07,166
During the three days
of your questioning,

732
00:53:07,628 --> 00:53:09,630
he watched over your lawyer.

733
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:13,788
And he checked all the ways

734
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:15,592
you might try to free yourself.

735
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:21,765
- Mr. Yoo, give us a comment!
- Mr. Yoo!

736
00:53:22,682 --> 00:53:26,519
When your arrest warrant
was nullified,

737
00:53:26,602 --> 00:53:28,604
he even came to see me.

738
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,334
(Missing Person)

739
00:53:39,074 --> 00:53:42,618
So you already knew
what happened two months ago.

740
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:44,912
If so, I would not have wasted
our time.

741
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:50,085
But if we don't know how he got in
and out of that room,

742
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:53,129
It is all useless, isn't it?

743
00:53:53,212 --> 00:53:55,885
Han Young-seok knows all
about you,

744
00:53:55,968 --> 00:53:57,633
but you know nothing.

745
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:02,766
So you can't see the key
to that closed room.

746
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:05,641
These are the crime photos.

747
00:54:13,401 --> 00:54:17,445
The key is outside the room,
not in it.

748
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:23,118
Do you recognize this person?

749
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:31,167
- No.
- Of course not.

750
00:54:33,629 --> 00:54:36,424
You have never met
Han Sun-jae's mother.

751
00:54:37,801 --> 00:54:41,260
She is even started working again.

752
00:54:41,637 --> 00:54:45,681
Your guest has already gone up
to the room.

753
00:54:46,101 --> 00:54:47,643
Would you like a second key?

754
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,564
Name: Lee Hee-jung.

755
00:54:53,272 --> 00:54:55,274
She worked
at the hotel's front desk.

756
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,247
Now you understand?

757
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:00,239
Why they called you to that hotel?

758
00:55:01,533 --> 00:55:02,878
Han Young-seok knew

759
00:55:02,961 --> 00:55:05,746
you would both
recognize the accident scene.

760
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:08,556
The fact you came to the hotel was

761
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,706
half a confession.

762
00:55:12,336 --> 00:55:14,631
The rest went according to plan.

763
00:55:25,514 --> 00:55:27,725
Booking the room next
to the storage closet

764
00:55:27,808 --> 00:55:30,101
was intentional.

765
00:55:41,445 --> 00:55:43,322
(The woman has gone up)

766
00:55:45,117 --> 00:55:49,373
Han Young-seok waited
for them in the closet.

767
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:01,885
Lee Hee-jung called the police.

768
00:56:27,452 --> 00:56:30,355
And Han staged the crime

769
00:56:30,438 --> 00:56:32,624
as the police were arriving.

770
00:56:33,874 --> 00:56:35,876
We received a call.

771
00:56:44,676 --> 00:56:46,678
Excuse me.

772
00:57:13,914 --> 00:57:15,669
Is everything okay?

773
00:57:15,752 --> 00:57:17,754
I heard a strange noise inside.

774
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:38,259
And he escaped the room

775
00:57:38,342 --> 00:57:40,275
with his wife's help.

776
00:58:02,086 --> 00:58:03,755
Help!

777
00:58:05,718 --> 00:58:06,882
Hands up!

778
00:58:07,635 --> 00:58:09,639
Don't move!

779
00:58:09,722 --> 00:58:10,848
It was not me.

780
00:58:10,931 --> 00:58:11,849
Don't move! Stay still!

781
00:58:11,932 --> 00:58:13,518
Another person is here!

782
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,228
Another person is here!

783
00:58:21,734 --> 00:58:25,109
If you want to prove
you did not kill Se-hee,

784
00:58:25,901 --> 00:58:28,573
you need to implicate
Han Young-seok.

785
00:58:28,656 --> 00:58:31,198
So you can't help
but pull in the Han Sun-jae case.

786
00:58:36,664 --> 00:58:37,971
The most incriminating thing is

787
00:58:38,054 --> 00:58:39,461
the bank hacking...

788
00:58:39,544 --> 00:58:42,294
It will be impossible
to prove it was me.

789
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:44,545
Good.

790
00:58:44,628 --> 00:58:46,839
That day, you were not
in the car with Se-hee.

791
00:58:46,922 --> 00:58:48,924
You were in Busan
as per your alibi.

792
00:58:49,718 --> 00:58:52,387
Se-hee, who often drove your car,
had the accident

793
00:58:53,137 --> 00:58:55,560
and covered it up herself.

794
00:58:56,725 --> 00:58:58,727
Then she stopped calling.

795
00:59:00,773 --> 00:59:04,233
So I become Se-hee's victim...

796
00:59:04,316 --> 00:59:05,854
You saw her in the hotel

797
00:59:05,937 --> 00:59:07,697
for the first time in two months,

798
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,739
and learned
about the Han Sun-jae incident.

799
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:15,899
If you had an accident in my car,

800
00:59:15,931 --> 00:59:18,162
you should have told me!

801
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:21,307
Why didn't you say something?

802
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:22,390
What do I do now?

803
00:59:29,673 --> 00:59:32,261
Is that possible?

804
00:59:32,344 --> 00:59:34,429
The dead don't talk.

805
00:59:35,055 --> 00:59:37,488
We need one more puzzle piece

806
00:59:37,571 --> 00:59:39,559
to prove she acted alone.

807
00:59:41,021 --> 00:59:44,271
Where is Han Sun-jae's car?

808
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,720
Still,

809
00:59:48,803 --> 00:59:50,070
the truck driver saw me.

810
00:59:50,862 --> 00:59:52,742
Testimony can't compete
with evidence.

811
00:59:52,825 --> 00:59:54,659
We can refute his credibility.

812
00:59:54,742 --> 00:59:56,889
The prosecutor won't sit still
during the appeal trial.

813
00:59:56,913 --> 00:59:58,915
We make sure there is no appeal.

814
01:00:02,627 --> 01:00:04,629
How?

815
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:07,012
We just need direct evidence

816
01:00:07,095 --> 01:00:09,133
that Se-hee killed Han Sun-jae.

817
01:00:09,713 --> 01:00:12,677
Then if Se-hee,
the only suspect, is dead,

818
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,180
the prosecutor can't indict.

819
01:00:15,263 --> 01:00:16,880
It will be impossible

820
01:00:16,963 --> 01:00:19,475
to prosecute the case.

821
01:00:20,561 --> 01:00:23,771
They just need to find something
of hers or DNA.

822
01:00:25,065 --> 01:00:26,460
But to plant it,

823
01:00:26,543 --> 01:00:27,899
we need the car.

824
01:00:30,154 --> 01:00:32,321
Isn't there another method?

825
01:00:32,404 --> 01:00:34,406
To prove Se-hee did it herself.

826
01:00:36,076 --> 01:00:37,578
You come up with one.

827
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:45,878
This is when I start doubting.

828
01:00:49,297 --> 01:00:50,707
When my client keeps trying

829
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:52,341
to deceive me.

830
01:00:52,424 --> 01:00:53,887
How am I deceiving you?

831
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:55,469
Are you telling the truth?

832
01:00:55,552 --> 01:00:56,760
Yes.

833
01:01:03,187 --> 01:01:05,937
You seemed to like the scenario
I imagined,

834
01:01:06,814 --> 01:01:08,249
no matter how well you
defend a lie,

835
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:11,192
it will collapse in court.

836
01:01:11,275 --> 01:01:12,693
Isn't it the truth?

837
01:01:12,776 --> 01:01:14,778
Only you know that.

838
01:01:18,158 --> 01:01:20,621
What if everything was reversed?

839
01:01:21,413 --> 01:01:22,455
Reversed?

840
01:01:26,834 --> 01:01:28,836
Removing Sun-jae's wallet,

841
01:01:32,379 --> 01:01:33,384
and hacking the bank was

842
01:01:33,467 --> 01:01:34,550
all your idea.

843
01:01:37,013 --> 01:01:40,348
And what if she was the one
who wanted to break up?

844
01:01:41,934 --> 01:01:43,351
Sorry.

845
01:01:44,184 --> 01:01:45,602
The person driving was not Se-hee,

846
01:01:48,356 --> 01:01:50,358
it was you.

847
01:01:56,032 --> 01:01:58,034
Shall we go back to the start?

848
01:02:02,747 --> 01:02:03,912
Hello?

849
01:02:03,995 --> 01:02:05,997
Sorry, what did you say?

850
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,040
When will you leave?

851
01:02:08,123 --> 01:02:10,087
As soon as I finish up here.

852
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:11,837
Hurry, I miss you.

853
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,420
You too.

854
01:02:32,525 --> 01:02:35,112
If you took the lead in all this,

855
01:02:35,195 --> 01:02:36,781
doesn't it fit better?

856
01:02:37,654 --> 01:02:40,657
- What are you doing?
- We should report it.

857
01:02:41,117 --> 01:02:42,449
Nobody saw it.

858
01:02:42,532 --> 01:02:44,120
We can just keep driving.

859
01:02:45,662 --> 01:02:47,584
If you call the cops,
we are both finished!

860
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:50,127
Get a grip!

861
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:53,755
What if this whole situation was
driven by you,

862
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:58,467
and Se-hee was the one
who tried to stop it?

863
01:02:58,775 --> 01:02:59,676
(Medical Report)

864
01:02:59,759 --> 01:03:01,761
These are psychiatric records
of Se-hee.

865
01:03:02,262 --> 01:03:03,677
After the accident,

866
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,057
she suffered severe anxiety.

867
01:03:08,104 --> 01:03:11,315
She could not take it anymore.

868
01:03:15,235 --> 01:03:20,406
Police say it may not be
a simple disappearance,

869
01:03:20,489 --> 01:03:23,200
but they are waiting
for conclusive evidence.

870
01:03:23,283 --> 01:03:26,620
Police are also tracing
the whereabouts of one woman.

871
01:03:26,703 --> 01:03:29,206
She was seen
by the missing man's father,

872
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:31,833
and was driving a stolen vehicle
on that day.

873
01:03:31,916 --> 01:03:34,608
Police are investigating
the possibility of a connection

874
01:03:34,691 --> 01:03:37,466
to the missing person case.

875
01:03:40,676 --> 01:03:42,678
Let's meet now and talk.

876
01:03:43,764 --> 01:03:45,766
I will go to you.

877
01:03:46,475 --> 01:03:47,814
Are you crazy?

878
01:03:47,897 --> 01:03:49,100
I told you not to call me.

879
01:03:49,518 --> 01:03:51,144
Why am I a suspect?

880
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:53,981
What did you tell the police?

881
01:03:58,611 --> 01:04:00,613
Hello.

882
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:04,449
Hello.

883
01:04:04,825 --> 01:04:06,827
This is my son.

884
01:04:12,584 --> 01:04:16,336
Finally, she made up her mind.

885
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:19,441
If she can't bring back their son,

886
01:04:19,524 --> 01:04:21,550
at least she can do
the right thing.

887
01:04:24,681 --> 01:04:26,346
Hello?

888
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:30,728
Se-hee called the boy's father.

889
01:04:30,811 --> 01:04:32,813
It was an accident.

890
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:35,022
Honey.

891
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:39,528
Promising she would find
the location of the son's body,

892
01:04:41,237 --> 01:04:42,824
she begged for forgiveness.

893
01:04:42,907 --> 01:04:45,826
I will tell you where your son is.

894
01:04:47,367 --> 01:04:49,369
I am sorry.

895
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,957
Then, why didn't he report it

896
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,598
after getting Se-hee's call?

897
01:05:08,681 --> 01:05:11,351
Proving a murder with nobody is
near impossible.

898
01:05:11,728 --> 01:05:13,855
Han must have known...

899
01:05:13,938 --> 01:05:16,648
That you would never say
where the body is.

900
01:05:17,774 --> 01:05:21,109
That you would always
find a way out.

901
01:05:22,278 --> 01:05:24,058
He just hoped

902
01:05:24,565 --> 01:05:27,285
Se-hee might find out
the body's location.

903
01:05:27,368 --> 01:05:28,785
But Ms. Yang.

904
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:32,997
Actually,
I was not passed out completely.

905
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:37,502
I saw him for sure
from that room.

906
01:05:37,918 --> 01:05:39,753
Why didn't you say so before?

907
01:05:39,836 --> 01:05:45,010
An attorney I have never met will
determine my fate.

908
01:05:45,093 --> 01:05:47,095
I need to judge, too.

909
01:05:48,597 --> 01:05:50,599
You never change.

910
01:05:51,267 --> 01:05:53,284
It is my job to make you innocent,

911
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:54,895
but I can't do it

912
01:05:55,187 --> 01:05:57,189
- if you lie.
- What lie?

913
01:05:58,647 --> 01:06:00,441
This photo proves it.

914
01:06:00,817 --> 01:06:03,482
This woman and her husband plotted

915
01:06:03,565 --> 01:06:05,447
to get revenge on me.

916
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:07,116
What stronger evidence is there?

917
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:09,201
That woman is not
Han Sun-jae's mother.

918
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:14,370
She is just a hotel employee.

919
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:17,293
I don't know her either.

920
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:21,130
There was never a third person
in that room.

921
01:06:21,213 --> 01:06:24,340
It was just you and Se-hee.

922
01:06:25,049 --> 01:06:27,969
At one mention
of Han Sun-jae's mother,

923
01:06:28,052 --> 01:06:30,223
you lie about seeing the father?

924
01:06:30,306 --> 01:06:31,764
If you know all this,

925
01:06:33,682 --> 01:06:35,393
why invent such a story?

926
01:06:35,476 --> 01:06:36,743
I need to hear the truth

927
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,520
from your mouth.

928
01:06:39,315 --> 01:06:41,026
I told you.

929
01:06:42,483 --> 01:06:43,860
Not to contact me.

930
01:06:45,069 --> 01:06:46,598
So why dream up this crap

931
01:06:46,681 --> 01:06:48,029
to get me out here?

932
01:06:48,112 --> 01:06:50,532
Otherwise you would never take
my calls.

933
01:06:50,615 --> 01:06:53,201
So what is it?
What do you want?

934
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,580
Let's confess.

935
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,752
It is not as if we killed him.

936
01:07:12,096 --> 01:07:14,098
Kim Se-hee...

937
01:07:16,184 --> 01:07:17,478
You have really gone mad.

938
01:07:21,145 --> 01:07:23,147
I called his parents.

939
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:26,194
I told them everything.

940
01:07:27,111 --> 01:07:29,614
Tell them where the car is,
and ask forgiveness.

941
01:07:40,208 --> 01:07:44,545
It was not Han Young-seok
who killed Se-hee.

942
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:47,632
I don't care what you do to me.

943
01:07:49,009 --> 01:07:51,844
My mind is made up.

944
01:07:54,515 --> 01:07:56,557
You killed Se-hee,

945
01:07:57,265 --> 01:07:59,267
and trapped yourself
in that closed room.

946
01:08:01,938 --> 01:08:03,651
You must have gone over it

947
01:08:03,734 --> 01:08:05,902
several times in your mind.

948
01:08:09,069 --> 01:08:12,909
Excuse me, sir.
Are you in there?

949
01:08:16,993 --> 01:08:18,368
This is the police.

950
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,541
Open the door!

951
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:23,460
I won't let you.

952
01:08:26,254 --> 01:08:28,256
Mr. Yoo.

953
01:08:29,966 --> 01:08:31,968
Salvation is never painless.

954
01:08:34,639 --> 01:08:36,973
And you are not
as smart as I am.

955
01:08:38,807 --> 01:08:40,809
Admit it, and tell the truth.

956
01:08:41,686 --> 01:08:43,604
Then everything will be easier.

957
01:08:46,274 --> 01:08:48,276
I will help you.

958
01:08:56,993 --> 01:09:00,581
Did you kill Kim Se-hee?

959
01:09:32,737 --> 01:09:33,737
Yes.

960
01:09:37,325 --> 01:09:39,327
I killed her.

961
01:09:58,971 --> 01:10:00,348
Very well.

962
01:10:01,057 --> 01:10:03,059
We will take a break,
then continue.

963
01:10:26,166 --> 01:10:28,044
It will all be over soon.

964
01:10:29,126 --> 01:10:31,128
We are almost there.

965
01:10:37,555 --> 01:10:40,096
Then what about his real mother?

966
01:10:41,221 --> 01:10:43,223
One thing I am sure of is that

967
01:10:45,642 --> 01:10:48,773
she must feel
like she died herself.

968
01:11:07,873 --> 01:11:09,459
You are back late.

969
01:11:10,418 --> 01:11:13,546
But I can't reach Sun-jae.

970
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:15,217
Really?

971
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,510
Yeah. He forgot his phone
at home.

972
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:21,638
I am sure he is out having fun.

973
01:11:23,972 --> 01:11:25,559
I am cold.

974
01:11:25,642 --> 01:11:28,854
We have the warrant
to search your home.

975
01:11:28,937 --> 01:11:30,564
What is going on?

976
01:11:30,647 --> 01:11:34,040
Your son may have been involved

977
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,652
in financial crimes.

978
01:11:54,294 --> 01:11:56,296
Honey!

979
01:12:03,805 --> 01:12:06,932
I know
about your son's disappearance.

980
01:12:08,144 --> 01:12:09,647
It was an accident.

981
01:12:11,187 --> 01:12:15,484
I will find out where he is.

982
01:12:19,945 --> 01:12:21,197
I am sorry.

983
01:12:25,994 --> 01:12:27,996
I am truly sorry.

984
01:12:31,207 --> 01:12:32,209
Breaking news.

985
01:12:32,292 --> 01:12:34,156
The head of an IT company has been

986
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:35,921
arrested on suspicion of murder.

987
01:12:36,004 --> 01:12:38,796
Police have requested an autopsy

988
01:12:38,879 --> 01:12:39,965
on the slain woman's body,

989
01:12:40,048 --> 01:12:43,888
while the suspect, Mr. Yoo,
vigorously denies the charges.

990
01:13:11,581 --> 01:13:12,710
Who are you?

991
01:13:15,713 --> 01:13:17,715
I will see you tonight.

992
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:22,592
Mom!

993
01:13:33,186 --> 01:13:35,027
However hard I try,

994
01:13:35,355 --> 01:13:37,190
I can't remember it.

995
01:13:38,315 --> 01:13:41,401
What my son said
to me that morning...

996
01:13:46,951 --> 01:13:48,953
It was the last time.

997
01:13:51,328 --> 01:13:53,027
I could sense my son every day

998
01:13:53,397 --> 01:13:55,291
when I woke up.

999
01:13:56,709 --> 01:14:00,172
Whether he was home, or out...

1000
01:14:02,467 --> 01:14:04,469
Every single day.

1001
01:14:06,971 --> 01:14:10,808
But now I can't feel anything.

1002
01:14:12,601 --> 01:14:14,520
What do you want?

1003
01:14:14,603 --> 01:14:16,814
I know that it was an accident.

1004
01:14:17,815 --> 01:14:20,500
Whether coincidence or a mistake,

1005
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:22,528
I won't demand anything.

1006
01:14:26,407 --> 01:14:29,410
But please... find my son.

1007
01:14:30,243 --> 01:14:31,868
These people

1008
01:14:33,246 --> 01:14:37,002
are not people
you can stand up to.

1009
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:07,130
(I must meet
the client right away.)

1010
01:15:07,213 --> 01:15:08,489
(Some new evidence...)

1011
01:15:16,372 --> 01:15:17,792
Hello?

1012
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:19,541
Are you ready?

1013
01:15:19,624 --> 01:15:22,464
Yes. I will leave right away.

1014
01:15:29,217 --> 01:15:33,221
(Manager Han)

1015
01:15:49,574 --> 01:15:51,786
It seems Attorney Jang is busy.

1016
01:15:51,869 --> 01:15:53,570
He will come after finishing up.

1017
01:15:53,653 --> 01:15:54,705
This way.

1018
01:15:54,788 --> 01:15:56,893
This was far for you to come

1019
01:15:57,259 --> 01:15:59,501
after an all-night interrogation.

1020
01:15:59,584 --> 01:16:01,710
I had to escape the press.

1021
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,841
You have not escaped
the prosecution, though.

1022
01:16:06,924 --> 01:16:07,980
Police are stationed 5 minutes

1023
01:16:08,004 --> 01:16:09,720
from here.

1024
01:16:09,803 --> 01:16:11,805
Is coffee okay?

1025
01:16:15,224 --> 01:16:16,851
Did she sign
the defense agreement?

1026
01:16:16,934 --> 01:16:18,144
No, not yet.

1027
01:16:18,227 --> 01:16:19,854
That is what Ms. Yang heard.

1028
01:16:19,937 --> 01:16:21,603
Let me speak to her.

1029
01:16:21,686 --> 01:16:23,232
Hello?

1030
01:16:23,315 --> 01:16:25,483
What is this about a witness?

1031
01:16:25,566 --> 01:16:27,027
I am not sure who...

1032
01:16:28,152 --> 01:16:29,238
Hello?

1033
01:16:29,321 --> 01:16:30,697
Ms. Yang?

1034
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:32,865
- Hello?
- Hello?

1035
01:16:36,786 --> 01:16:37,831
We were cut off.

1036
01:16:54,972 --> 01:16:57,642
So where were we?

1037
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:04,982
You said we needed
material evidence to prove

1038
01:17:05,065 --> 01:17:07,985
that Se-hee killed the boy.

1039
01:17:08,068 --> 01:17:09,819
Right.

1040
01:17:11,236 --> 01:17:13,199
I have one of Se-hee's bracelets.

1041
01:17:13,282 --> 01:17:14,322
Good.

1042
01:17:18,619 --> 01:17:20,372
We will plant the evidence,

1043
01:17:21,498 --> 01:17:23,262
then tell the police the location

1044
01:17:23,345 --> 01:17:25,041
in an anonymous tip.

1045
01:17:26,003 --> 01:17:29,171
Tell Attorney Jang
to reinforce the Busan alibi.

1046
01:17:29,254 --> 01:17:31,634
The fact you concealed knowledge
of the crime will get

1047
01:17:31,717 --> 01:17:33,719
you probation at most.

1048
01:17:33,802 --> 01:17:35,012
Ms. Yang.

1049
01:17:35,928 --> 01:17:39,932
Doesn't probation mean guilty?

1050
01:17:40,685 --> 01:17:43,188
I want to be not guilty.

1051
01:17:46,398 --> 01:17:48,400
We will do our best.

1052
01:17:49,567 --> 01:17:52,906
But first
we need to plant the evidence.

1053
01:17:53,991 --> 01:17:57,495
Where is the car?

1054
01:18:10,588 --> 01:18:12,009
Sunk in a lake.

1055
01:18:29,815 --> 01:18:31,275
With the body?

1056
01:18:32,069 --> 01:18:33,069
Yes.

1057
01:18:47,501 --> 01:18:49,503
There are many lakes
in that area.

1058
01:18:51,171 --> 01:18:52,674
Where exactly?

1059
01:18:52,757 --> 01:18:55,005
But what if that truck driver has

1060
01:18:55,088 --> 01:18:56,761
some kind of evidence?

1061
01:18:58,055 --> 01:19:00,095
Then we would be revealing
the location for nothing.

1062
01:19:00,389 --> 01:19:02,139
The prosecution has no witnesses.

1063
01:19:02,891 --> 01:19:04,142
What?

1064
01:19:04,225 --> 01:19:05,305
Any witness would have come

1065
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:07,019
forward two months ago.

1066
01:19:08,397 --> 01:19:10,304
I made it up

1067
01:19:10,387 --> 01:19:11,587
to get your confession faster.

1068
01:19:13,402 --> 01:19:18,448
Then, rushing over here
because of the prosecutor...

1069
01:19:20,493 --> 01:19:21,743
That was a lie too?

1070
01:19:22,034 --> 01:19:24,036
We saved time,

1071
01:19:24,582 --> 01:19:28,001
and discovered a way
to prove you innocent.

1072
01:19:28,917 --> 01:19:31,796
You agree to defend me, right?

1073
01:19:39,469 --> 01:19:42,263
Now that you are
officially my lawyer,

1074
01:19:42,346 --> 01:19:44,141
you are bound
by confidentiality, right?

1075
01:20:17,842 --> 01:20:19,844
There is one thing
I have not told you.

1076
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:59,592
I thought he was dead.

1077
01:21:01,927 --> 01:21:03,136
Really.

1078
01:21:08,934 --> 01:21:10,267
Save me!

1079
01:21:11,144 --> 01:21:14,524
What are you saying?

1080
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:18,235
It was too late to turn back.

1081
01:22:02,947 --> 01:22:04,949
When it was over,

1082
01:22:05,032 --> 01:22:06,323
I could not find the wrench.

1083
01:22:07,244 --> 01:22:08,708
I searched,

1084
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:11,037
but it must have
ended up in the trunk.

1085
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,330
Please take care of it.

1086
01:22:12,413 --> 01:22:13,533
When you plant the evidence,

1087
01:22:13,602 --> 01:22:15,710
get rid of the wrench.

1088
01:22:15,793 --> 01:22:17,628
You said it was an accident.

1089
01:22:17,711 --> 01:22:20,381
By then it was too late anyway.

1090
01:22:21,631 --> 01:22:23,593
How could you...?

1091
01:22:24,093 --> 01:22:25,615
I know it is difficult,

1092
01:22:25,698 --> 01:22:26,616
but please help me.

1093
01:22:26,699 --> 01:22:28,638
Did you say he was alive?

1094
01:22:30,099 --> 01:22:32,101
You could have saved him.

1095
01:22:32,977 --> 01:22:35,229
Despite your excuses,
you are a murderer.

1096
01:22:35,312 --> 01:22:37,190
You said you wanted the truth.

1097
01:22:38,023 --> 01:22:39,526
So you can defend me.

1098
01:22:39,609 --> 01:22:41,735
You don't deserve one bit
of help.

1099
01:22:42,195 --> 01:22:44,531
- What?
- You killed two people.

1100
01:22:44,614 --> 01:22:46,280
If people find out,
you are finished!

1101
01:22:46,363 --> 01:22:47,533
Shut up!

1102
01:22:55,625 --> 01:22:57,627
You are my lawyer now.

1103
01:22:58,544 --> 01:23:01,879
So do your damn job.
Got it?

1104
01:24:31,348 --> 01:24:33,679
(I know where Sun-jae...)

1105
01:24:34,848 --> 01:24:35,933
Ms. Yang?

1106
01:24:37,475 --> 01:24:38,560
Yes?

1107
01:24:39,685 --> 01:24:41,314
I am sorry for shouting.

1108
01:24:44,233 --> 01:24:46,568
Our contract is still valid,
right?

1109
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:49,947
Of course.

1110
01:24:50,948 --> 01:24:53,368
I can't break confidentiality,

1111
01:24:53,451 --> 01:24:55,537
or it will leave a black mark
on my career.

1112
01:25:00,418 --> 01:25:02,207
Let me formally request your help.

1113
01:25:26,275 --> 01:25:27,276
Which lake is it?

1114
01:25:50,215 --> 01:25:51,593
Is that correct?

1115
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:54,972
Yes.

1116
01:25:55,513 --> 01:25:57,179
Very well.

1117
01:25:57,262 --> 01:25:59,933
I will arrange
to plant the evidence right away.

1118
01:26:50,147 --> 01:26:51,569
(Attorney Yang Shin-ae)

1119
01:27:18,556 --> 01:27:19,556
Just a minute.

1120
01:27:25,979 --> 01:27:28,938
Sorry, you scared me.

1121
01:27:31,569 --> 01:27:32,803
You won't get out that way.

1122
01:27:33,183 --> 01:27:34,445
I will get you chains.

1123
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:36,073
Come wait inside.

1124
01:28:08,269 --> 01:28:10,271
Where did I put them?

1125
01:28:14,777 --> 01:28:16,779
Can I ask you something?

1126
01:28:17,531 --> 01:28:18,531
What is it?

1127
01:28:21,242 --> 01:28:23,786
How did you get
to know the Chairman?

1128
01:28:26,996 --> 01:28:29,083
Through a lawsuit, of course.

1129
01:28:29,583 --> 01:28:31,585
Really?

1130
01:28:33,587 --> 01:28:35,841
I heard you were
from the same hometown.

1131
01:28:36,923 --> 01:28:37,967
That too.

1132
01:28:39,136 --> 01:28:41,636
I mean, we first met in court...

1133
01:28:41,719 --> 01:28:44,598
Ah, there they are.

1134
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,562
Would you bring me that stool?

1135
01:29:01,824 --> 01:29:03,076
Thank you.

1136
01:29:13,751 --> 01:29:16,297
You lie, too.

1137
01:29:21,844 --> 01:29:24,221
The Chairman's hometown is
in North Korea.

1138
01:29:38,403 --> 01:29:40,906
Who are you?

1139
01:29:47,705 --> 01:29:49,078
Lee Hee-jung.

1140
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:53,752
The mother of the man you killed.

1141
01:29:56,338 --> 01:29:59,341
Then that makes sense.

1142
01:29:59,841 --> 01:30:01,592
That boy did nothing wrong.

1143
01:30:03,801 --> 01:30:05,764
You went too far.

1144
01:30:05,847 --> 01:30:07,557
So did you.

1145
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:09,642
Your theory of Se-hee shocked me.

1146
01:30:09,725 --> 01:30:11,854
Almost perfectly accurate.

1147
01:30:11,937 --> 01:30:13,502
That is when I decided

1148
01:30:13,585 --> 01:30:17,108
I could put my fate in your hands.

1149
01:30:17,191 --> 01:30:21,739
Then you should have practiced
the signature.

1150
01:30:23,614 --> 01:30:25,492
So what is it?

1151
01:30:26,576 --> 01:30:28,952
What do you want from me?

1152
01:30:29,035 --> 01:30:30,372
Do you want an apology?

1153
01:30:31,749 --> 01:30:34,876
No, just let me find him.

1154
01:30:36,334 --> 01:30:37,672
That map?

1155
01:30:37,755 --> 01:30:40,297
I almost told you for real, but...

1156
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:46,011
You were acting so strange.

1157
01:30:48,683 --> 01:30:52,185
Right, both of us were unlucky.

1158
01:30:52,894 --> 01:30:54,772
It was an accident, as you said.

1159
01:30:55,690 --> 01:30:57,146
I won't bother you anymore.

1160
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:02,112
You can't just leave.

1161
01:31:03,445 --> 01:31:05,115
- Wait!
- Let go of me!

1162
01:31:13,330 --> 01:31:15,627
Hello?
This is Mount 23.

1163
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:17,782
Help,
someone is trying to kill me.

1164
01:31:17,865 --> 01:31:18,961
Come quickly.

1165
01:32:05,007 --> 01:32:07,470
Do you think you are smarter
than me?

1166
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:10,428
What is more important is

1167
01:32:13,515 --> 01:32:15,517
to survive.

1168
01:33:02,525 --> 01:33:05,611
We have a shooting incident.
Please send an ambulance.

1169
01:33:26,339 --> 01:33:29,091
Hello?
This is Mount 23.

1170
01:33:29,174 --> 01:33:30,464
Help,
someone is trying to kill me.

1171
01:33:30,488 --> 01:33:31,802
Come quickly.

1172
01:33:32,803 --> 01:33:34,137
That is everything.

1173
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:35,264
We got the call,

1174
01:33:35,347 --> 01:33:36,892
and a nearby police car came.

1175
01:33:36,975 --> 01:33:39,562
We arrested Lee Hee-jung
with the gun in her hands.

1176
01:33:43,312 --> 01:33:44,230
How is he?

1177
01:33:44,313 --> 01:33:46,108
The wound is not serious.

1178
01:33:46,191 --> 01:33:47,356
The road conditions are bad,

1179
01:33:47,439 --> 01:33:48,902
so we will treat him here first.

1180
01:33:49,611 --> 01:33:52,823
I don't want to see
those people ever again.

1181
01:33:52,906 --> 01:33:54,494
Don't worry.

1182
01:33:54,577 --> 01:33:56,118
Attempted murder is a felony.

1183
01:33:56,201 --> 01:33:58,203
Even for a first offense,
it is serious.

1184
01:34:02,375 --> 01:34:04,504
What about the recording
from their car?

1185
01:34:04,587 --> 01:34:06,084
Whatever you said,

1186
01:34:06,167 --> 01:34:07,273
illegal wiretapping can't be used

1187
01:34:07,297 --> 01:34:09,757
as evidence in court.

1188
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,970
Contrarily, the recording shows
you are a victim.

1189
01:34:24,855 --> 01:34:27,108
The police will visit you
in the hospital.

1190
01:34:27,774 --> 01:34:28,983
But don't worry.

1191
01:34:29,066 --> 01:34:31,068
I will take care of it all.

1192
01:34:45,043 --> 01:34:46,127
Just a minute!

1193
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:05,397
Good news!

1194
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:06,814
What is it?

1195
01:35:06,897 --> 01:35:08,686
That truck driver passed away.

1196
01:35:09,082 --> 01:35:10,082
A month ago.

1197
01:35:12,446 --> 01:35:13,773
Is it crude,

1198
01:35:13,856 --> 01:35:15,822
calling that good news?

1199
01:35:17,323 --> 01:35:20,326
They said
the prosecution has no witness.

1200
01:35:20,619 --> 01:35:21,995
Really?

1201
01:35:26,291 --> 01:35:28,335
How is Attorney Yang?

1202
01:35:28,418 --> 01:35:30,003
She is the best.

1203
01:35:31,381 --> 01:35:32,839
Could not be better.

1204
01:35:33,591 --> 01:35:35,087
That is what we want.

1205
01:35:35,675 --> 01:35:37,637
Could not be better.

1206
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,722
Thanks for your help.

1207
01:35:57,532 --> 01:36:02,581
The patient's condition seems
good.

1208
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:15,882
You have only made things
more complicated.

1209
01:36:16,302 --> 01:36:17,884
Can you handle it?

1210
01:36:18,804 --> 01:36:20,760
You came too far.

1211
01:36:20,843 --> 01:36:22,932
We should have stopped
at the rest stop.

1212
01:36:29,315 --> 01:36:31,317
Yoo Min-ho...

1213
01:36:34,068 --> 01:36:36,822
Don't defend him.

1214
01:36:38,115 --> 01:36:40,743
I say this as my apology to you.

1215
01:36:47,413 --> 01:36:51,417
You will lose for sure.

1216
01:36:58,380 --> 01:37:00,804
Stop!

1217
01:37:00,887 --> 01:37:02,806
Slowly, slowly!

1218
01:37:02,889 --> 01:37:04,808
Come forward!

1219
01:37:04,891 --> 01:37:07,727
- Go ahead.
- Ambulance, stand by!

1220
01:37:07,810 --> 01:37:08,935
Confirmed.

1221
01:37:18,572 --> 01:37:22,493
Yoo Min-ho came here
for a reason.

1222
01:37:22,576 --> 01:37:25,369
Attorney Yang says she will go
directly to your cabin.

1223
01:37:25,452 --> 01:37:26,621
All right.

1224
01:37:42,596 --> 01:37:44,765
This was far for you to come

1225
01:37:45,137 --> 01:37:46,558
after an all-night interrogation.

1226
01:37:46,641 --> 01:37:49,186
I had to escape the press.

1227
01:37:53,231 --> 01:37:55,233
He had something to do here.

1228
01:37:59,614 --> 01:38:01,239
When it was over,

1229
01:38:01,634 --> 01:38:02,949
I could not find the wrench.

1230
01:38:04,034 --> 01:38:05,367
What do you mean?

1231
01:38:07,285 --> 01:38:08,747
My son...

1232
01:38:14,753 --> 01:38:17,214
I think I know where he is.

1233
01:38:18,881 --> 01:38:20,843
A place where no one
would stumble across it.

1234
01:38:22,344 --> 01:38:24,346
A place only he knows.

1235
01:38:42,529 --> 01:38:44,531
Sunk in a lake.

1236
01:38:45,616 --> 01:38:47,326
This is private property!

1237
01:38:47,409 --> 01:38:49,246
It is also a crime scene.

1238
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:51,999
Criminal code,
article 216, clause 1.

1239
01:38:52,082 --> 01:38:54,935
A crime scene can be searched

1240
01:38:55,268 --> 01:38:57,252
without a warrant.

1241
01:38:57,335 --> 01:38:59,507
Diving team, access
from behind the cabin.

1242
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:02,176
Other search teams,
you can enter the property.

1243
01:39:02,925 --> 01:39:04,178
Cabin team, go ahead.

1244
01:39:04,261 --> 01:39:06,263
Everybody move!

1245
01:39:27,866 --> 01:39:29,496
(Yoo Min-ho)

1246
01:40:44,110 --> 01:40:46,112
Found it!

1247
01:41:28,531 --> 01:41:30,673
You are under arrest

1248
01:41:30,756 --> 01:41:32,827
for the murder of Han Sun-jae.

1249
01:41:50,136 --> 01:41:51,301
Mr. Yoo.

1250
01:41:54,348 --> 01:41:56,350
Salvation is never painless.

1251
01:41:57,936 --> 01:42:01,019
Admit it, and tell the truth.

1252
01:42:03,065 --> 01:42:05,067
I will help you.
